## Raw Thoughts

Unlike more advanced frameworks, Animating on the playdate is, well, more
hands-on. You can't just say go from A to B. You have to draw things at all
times between them.


## Animators
Ok, I take that back. Animators look like they handle that for you, just by letting you describe the start, end, duration, etc.

You can animate
- between two arbitrary points
- Along a line, arc, or geometric path

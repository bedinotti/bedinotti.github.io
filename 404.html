    Hey there. Looks like you found a dead link. Or were just digging around. 
    In any case, there's nothing here. If you thought there <emphasis>would</emphasis> 
    be something here, consider <a href="mailto:me@vanessa.fyi">letting me know</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    And if you were just digging around, no worries. How can I be upset at that face? ðŸ¥°
